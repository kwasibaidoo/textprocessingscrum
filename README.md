# __Version Control and Scrum__

## Project Objectives:
- Encourage the team to implement Scrum processes within the project workflow. 
- Integrate Git and GitHub workflows using Gitflow branching strategy. 
- Facilitate effective collaboration and communication among team members. 
- Enforce guidelines for writing descriptive and informative commit messages. 
- Evaluate engineers' adherence to Scrum processes, Git/GitHub workflows, and collaborative practices. 
- Assess teamwork and collaboration skills based on Scrum adherence, Git/GitHub proficiency, collaborative practices, and commit message quality. 
## Description:
The Text Processing and Data Management Tool project will serve as the foundation for assessing the engineers' collaboration skills within a Scrum team. Since every engineer has already implemented this project, you can use your existing code to speed the development process. The goal is to incorporate Scrum methodologies and Git/GitHub workflows, enabling the evaluation of the team's ability to work effectively in an agile software development environment.
## Features:
1. Scrum Implementation: 
    - Integrate Scrum processes such as sprint planning, daily standups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives into the project workflow. 
    - We will work with: 
        - 4hrs sprint (the duration of an entire sprint) 
        - 15 minutes Stand-up (after every 2hour of work, the team will perform a stand-up meeting) 
- Assign roles within the Scrum team (e.g., Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team) and rotate roles throughout the project duration. 
2. Git and GitHub Usage: 
    - Implement Gitflow branching strategy to manage feature development, releases, and hotfixes. Kindly follow AmaliTech Git standards. 
    - Utilize Git commands for branching, merging, rebasing, and resolving conflicts. 
    - Create pull requests for feature branches, conduct code reviews, and incorporate feedback from team members. 
3. Collaboration Practices: 
    - Encourage collaboration among team members through effective communication channels (e.g. Slack). 
    - Foster a culture of code ownership, accountability, and knowledge sharing within the team. 
4. Proper Commit Messages: 
    - Enforce guidelines for writing descriptive and informative commit messages that adhere to best practices. 
    - Ensure that commit messages accurately reflect the changes made and provide context for reviewers and future developers.
